## Solution

When entering, we are greeted with a web page that let us announce the input which we entered.

## Solution Approach

### What is SSTI?
Server-Side Template Injection occurs when an attacker can inject malicious template directives into a template, which are then executed server-side. This can lead to:
- Remote code execution
- Information disclosure
- File system access

### Common SSTI Payloads
```
{{7*7}}
${7*7}
<%= 7*7 %>
{{config}}
{{''.__class__.__mro__[2].__subclasses__()}}
```

### Exploitation Steps
1. Identify the template engine being used
2. Test for SSTI vulnerability with basic math operations
3. Escalate to more complex payloads for information disclosure or RCE
4. Extract the flag

## Flag

## Key Takeaways
- Always sanitize user input before embedding in templates
- Use safe template rendering methods
- Implement proper input validation
- Consider using sandboxed template engines

## Tools Used
- Web browser
- Burp Suite (optional)
- SSTI payload lists
